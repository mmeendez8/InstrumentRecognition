# Instrument recognition using Neural Networks

## Introduction

We present a simple system for musical instruments recognition where we have proceed following the next steps:

 1. Retrieval of the main components of different audios using Fourier Transform and Harmonic analysis (see appendix)
 2. Created our own NN library using Python
3. Training of the network using over ten thousand audio samples of a total of ten different instruments played by different people using different techniques.
 4. Comparison of results with other works
5. Future work and possible improvements
